<h2>Buttons</h2>

<p>The function of most buttons should be obvious, but a few may need 
explanation:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Zoom</dt>
<dd>Also known as "Aspect" or "Window" on pre-Premiere remotes; they all 
use the same code.</dd>

<dt>Aspt</dt>
<dd>This displays a menu that lets you send discrete codes to select each
mode. It's the only way to access the TiVo's hidden stretch mode, and it's
useful in HME apps that do video streaming, but don't act on the Zoom
IRCODE.</dd>

<dt>CC</dt>
<dd>Closed-caption menu; now uses discrete commands for this purpose
instead of the Info-Down-etc. sequence used in older versions.</dd>

<dt>Vid</dt>
<dd>A menu of options to change the output video mode. Note that these
actually change the options set in Settings > Video > Video Output
Format. They may or may not change the current video mode! Also, the
list of codes has not been updated to include 1080p modes. Use with
caution.</dd>

<dt>Misc</dt>
<dd>A menu of macros (multi-code sequences) and other functions. "Clock"
sends Select-Play-Select-9-Select, to toggle the on-screen clock.
"SPS30" sends Select-Play-Select-3-0-Select, to change the behavior of
the Advance/Skip button between the default mode and 30-second skip.
These should be used during playback of a recording, not LiveTV. "Find
remote" and "Netflix" are also here.</dd>

<dt>Adv</dt>
<dd>Advance" also known as "the button with an arrow pointing to a
line". This is your 30-second skip/slip or catch-up button, also used to
enter the dash for OTA channels.</dd>

<dt>A/B/C/D</dt>
<dd>The multicolored buttons found on the latest TiVo remotes.</dd>

<dt>Kbd</dt>
<dd>Sends the text in the "Text:" window (see below). Note that you can 
just hit "Enter" on your keyboard when the text field is in focus to 
accomplish the same thing (not to be confused with "Enter" on the 
remote).</dd>

<dt>Standby</dt>
<dd>Puts the TiVo into standby mode, or pulls it out of it (into LiveTV) 
if it already was. This function is available as a discrete remote code 
for universal remotes, but isn't on the standard peanuts.</dd>

<dt>Quit</dt>
<dd>Exits the remote program; doesn't send anything to the TiVo.</dd>
</dl>
